CS Student | Full-Stack & Systems Enthusiast | Networking Learner

## 📚 About Me

I’m a Computer Science student at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Banja Luka.  
My main interests lie in **system engineering, networking, and IT infrastructure**, where I enjoy building, configuring, and optimizing systems that make technology reliable and efficient.  

I also explore **web development** as a creative outlet — blending design and logic to deliver clean, functional solutions.  

Currently, I’m diving deeper into:  
- Networking fundamentals (Cisco NetAcad, CCST/CCNA prep)  
- Linux & Windows Server administration  
- Cloud and virtualization technologies  

Outside of tech, I’m passionate about motorsports, especially **Formula 1**, which inspires my focus on precision, performance, and constant improvement.
